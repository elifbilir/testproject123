//dryRun determines if we want to execute the step_definitions or not
        // if dryRun is true: dryRun is turned on, and step definitions are turned off (will not run)
        // if dryRun is false: dryRun is turned off, and step definitions are turned on (will run)

 this is mostly used for when implementing new steps and step defitions, and we do not want to run the code and open browser etc, just to get the snippets.
        - we turn off the step_definitions and just generate snippets

    - tags:
        - What are tags and why we use them?
        - Tags allows us to create different scenario suites or groups to run
        - we can include, or exclude different feature files or scenarios using tags.
